-- enter 'e' to establish connection with robot via port, you will be asked provide right after
    (COM3, COM4, COM5, etc...), and baudrate on which works arduino
-- enter 'c' to send a command:
    1) enter 'm' to make robot pass distance, specified right afterwords, between -200 and 200
	f.e. m -20
    2) enter 'r' to turn robot for an angle, specified right afterwords, between -200 and 200
	f.e. r 30
    3) enter 'v' to set the speed for the robot, then specify the speed, between 0 and 254
	f.e. v 250
    4) enter 'b' to read the robot's sonar
    5) enter 'i' to read robot's IR
    6) enter 'P' to set proportional coefficient for PID algorithm
    6) enter 'I' to set integral coefficient for PID algorithm
    6) enter 'D' to set derivative coefficient for PID algorithm
    7) enter 'g' to start PID algorithm for following a line
    8) enter 'S' to stop PID algorithm
    9) enter 'back', to go back to the menu
