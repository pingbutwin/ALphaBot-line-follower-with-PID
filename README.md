# ALphaBot-line-follower-with-PID
This project introduces a comprehensive control system for the AlphaBot mobile robot, integrating high-level control with autonomous capabilities. The architecture relies on two-way communication between a Python control interface and a low-level controller implemented on Arduino (C++). I developed a custom PySerial protocol to facilitate reliable exchange of commands and sensor data (sonar, IR). A key feature is the implementation of a PID control algorithm in C++, which ensures high-precision and stable black line following even on challenging routes. The user interface (Terminal UI) offers a simple way to dispatch commands (speed, direction, distance) and includes a detailed explanation of the command syntax for controlling the robot. The project demonstrates expertise in embedded systems, protocol design, and real-time control algorithm implementation.
