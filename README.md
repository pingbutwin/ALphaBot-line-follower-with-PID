# ALphaBot-line-follower-with-PID
This project implements an integrated control system for the AlphaBot robot via a Python Terminal UI and a custom PySerial protocol for communication with the Arduino (C++) controller. The user can send simple directional commands, while the core PID algorithm is used to achieve highly accurate autonomous line following.
